# Predicting House Prices Project

Both python and jupyter notebook files are provided. The project uses Random Forest regression to predict house prices.
Dataset includes the following features:
  - Average Area Income
  - Average Area House Age
  - Average Area Number of Rooms
  - Average Area Number of Bedrooms
  - Area Population
  - Price (target)
  - Address

The program prints out the accuracy of the predictions along with a view of the actual house prices next to the predicted prices.
